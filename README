# CD with Jenkins, Nexus, Sonarqube and Elastic Beanstalk for deployment of application (project 19)

This is project 19.

# Set up a new local workspace and a new remote repository for project19 as this will diverge from project18 signficantly.

The branch ci-jenkins in project 19 is just to retest the CI pipeline from project 8 and project 18

Project 19 uses a new remote repo but is the same exact code for the CI pipeline.  Webhook for jenkins is added.

The code is cloned from the project18 repo git clone https://github.com/dmastrop/CD_jenkins_ansible_nexus.git

Only the main and ci-jenkins branches were checked out prior to resetting the origin in the local workspace

 % git branch -a
* ci-jenkins
  main
  remotes/origin/ci-jenkins
  remotes/origin/main
